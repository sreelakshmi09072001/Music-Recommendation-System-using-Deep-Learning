# ðŸŽµ Music Recommender System using Embedding Layers & ANN

This project builds a **music recommendation system** that suggests similar songs based on their features using **deep learning** techniques like **embedding layers** and **approximate nearest neighbor (ANN)** search.

It combines the power of:
- **Neural networks**
- **Embedding representations**
- **Content-based filtering**
- **Approximate nearest neighbor search using PyNNDescent**

---

## ðŸ§  Technologies Used

- **Python**
- **PyTorch** â€“ for neural networks and embedding layers
- **PyNNDescent** â€“ for fast approximate nearest neighbor search
- **NumPy**, **Pandas** â€“ for data processing

---

## ðŸ§© Features

- Preprocesses song features into a format usable by neural networks
- Learns **dense vector embeddings** from high-dimensional multi-hot and numerical data
- Uses **PyNNDescent** for fast nearest-neighbor queries in embedding space
- Produces **recommendations based on learned similarity**, not just genre overlap
